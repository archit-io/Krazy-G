How It's Made

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web application is built using vanilla JavaScript. The server is built using Express.js. The database used is MongoDB. It is a single page application in which all pages are rendered in the index.html.

## Optimizations

It is planned to add multiple other features to make this app more useful to the end users:

1) Sending email for user validation.

2) Spawning and forking more threads in the Express server to support higher spike in traffic.

3) Load balancing

4) More security measures like - DDoS protection.

5) More application features like: ability to read book excerpts, interacting with other users through         personal messages and comments. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me learn to build a single page application using vanilla JavaScript.
